== SmallRye Stork

SmallRye Stork, Stork in short, is an extensible Service Discovery and Client-Side
Load Balancer implementation designed to work well with reactive libraries.
Stork APIs use https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/[SmallRye Mutiny].

Stork maps service names to addresses.

Required `ServiceDiscovery` provides a list of addresses (as `ServiceInstance`)
for a given service name.
Optional `LoadBalancer` selects a single `ServiceInstance` for a call.  

=== Configuring user applications
The project's core aims to be vendor neutral. Aside from using Mutiny for the APIs,
it has no dependencies. As such, it provides a universal abstraction of configuration 
and vendors can choose their own way of providing Stork configuration.

MicroProfile based frameworks can use MicroProfile Config to configure Stork.
Below is an example snippet of such a configuration:

[source,properties]
----
stork.my-service.service-discovery=consul
stork.my-service.service-discovery.some-service-discovery-property=property-value
stork.my-service.load-balancer=round-robin
stork.my-service.load-balancer.some-load-balancer-property=some-prop-value

stork.my-other-service.service-discovery=test-sd-1
stork.my-other-service.load-balancer=test-lb-1
----

MicroProfile Config support for configuring SmallRye Stork is provided by the
`smallrye-stork-microprofile` artifact.

=== Integrating client libraries with Stork
Client libraries would most often use a `LoadBalancer` to get a single address
for a call.
`LoadBalancer` for a service can be retrieved from `Stork` singleton:

[source,java]
----
LoadBalancer loadBalancer = Stork.getInstance().getLoadBalancer(serviceName);
Uni<ServiceInstance> serviceInstance = loadBalancer.selectServiceInstace();
----

Alternatively, one can retrieve a stream of all available `ServiceInstance`'s for a 
given service from `ServiceDiscovery`:

[source,java]
----
ServiceDiscovery serviceDiscovery = Stork.getInstance().getServiceDiscovery(serviceName);
Multi<ServiceInstance> serviceInstances = serviceDiscovery.getServiceInstances();
----

=== Extending the functionality
In Stork, extensibility is based on the
[Service Provider Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html) mechanism.

==== Configuration provider
To add a custom configuration provider, create an implementation of `ConfigProvider`
and register it with the Service Provider Interfaces mechanism.

SmallRye Stork comes with MicroProfile Config based configuration provider.
To use it, add `smallrye-stork-microprofile` to your project.

==== Service Discovery
To implement a custom service discovery for Stork, implement the `ServiceDiscoveryProvider`
interface and register it with the Service Provider Interface mechanism.

Please note that the `ServiceDiscovery` implementation must be non-blocking.

==== Load Balancer
To implement a custom load balancer for Stork, implement the `LoadBalancerProvider`
interface and register it with the Service Provider Interface mechanism.

Please note that the `LoadBalancer` implementation, similarly to `ServiceDiscovery` 
must be non-blocking.

=== Contributing
The following are required to build the project:

- JDK 11+
- Maven 3.6.3+

IntelliJ IDEA may think that the project uses
Java 8. To fix it, go to Maven -> Profiles and deselect
`include-jdk-misc` and `compile-java8-release-flag`
profiles.


==== TODOs

===== Service Discovery refresh
We may have a couple of modes for service discovery refresh

- server push - we keep a list of service instances and always return the list until a
notification comes that we need to update it
- eager refresh - refresh service instances on an interval basis
- lazy refresh - when invoked and configured interval since the last refresh happened,
refetch the data before return the result
    * it may be good to have a separate option to return the old data until the
refresh is complete

===== Gathering statistics
For smart Load Balancers we need statistics for calls.

===== Scheduling
For eager refresh, it may be good to provide a "helper" - a facade for scheduling tasks.
Such a facade could have bindings for Vert.x, Quartz, etc.
